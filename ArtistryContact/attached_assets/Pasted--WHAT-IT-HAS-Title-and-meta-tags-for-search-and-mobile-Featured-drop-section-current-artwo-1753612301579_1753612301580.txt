  <h2>🎨 Current Drop: "Fading Hope, Fighting Back"</h2>
  <img src="/mnt/data/P1000496.JPG" alt="Fading Hope, Fighting Back" width="400">
  <p>A man stands on the edge, a heart ablaze, staring over the sleeping city. It's not the fire that kills us — it's the silence. This is what it looks like to scream with no one to hear.</p>

  <h2>🕰️ Previous Drops</h2>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"Shelter City"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000507.JPG" alt="Shelter City" width="300">
    <p>The skyline burns while the forgotten build tents below it. A silhouette stares from the ashes. Home isn't a place, it's survival.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"This Side / That Side"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000498.JPG" alt="This Side That Side" width="300">
    <p>Split between warmth and cold, safety and chaos — this piece captures the mental divide we walk every day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"Alley Light"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000503.JPG" alt="Alley Light" width="300">
    <p>Silhouettes drift through dim light — never seen, never known. But they're there. Just like you. Just like me.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"Exit Wound"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000504.JPG" alt="Exit Wound" width="300">
    <p>Trapped between concrete walls and a toxic sky, the only way out is forward. The silhouette casts a shadow longer than its past.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"Underwatch"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000505.JPG" alt="Underwatch" width="300">
    <p>How many stories hide under flickering streetlights? Some walk through. Others never leave.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"See Me / Don’t"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000509.JPG" alt="See Me Don’t" width="300">
    <p>Lit from behind, unseen from the front. We all know what it’s like to be walked past, looked through, ignored.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"Ghost Walk"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000510.JPG" alt="Ghost Walk" width="300">
    <p>Blues and reds blur the lines between souls. One body, two selves, a street that remembers every fight and every step.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="art-piece">
    <h3>"Two Faces"</h3>
    <img src="/mnt/data/P1000511.JPG" alt="Two Faces" width="300">
    <p>Raw. One side ice, one side fire. This is duality. The battle between who we are and what we had to become.</p>
